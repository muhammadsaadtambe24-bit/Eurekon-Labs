Project Title: Natural Language Image Search Web App

Goal:
Build a full-stack web application MVP that allows users to upload multiple images (photos, screenshots, documents) and later search those images using normal human language queries like “UPI transaction screenshot”, “college ID card”, or “blue shirt near lake”.

Tech Stack (must follow):

Backend: Python + Flask

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (modern, clean UI)

AI Libraries: EasyOCR (for text extraction), Pillow / NumPy (for image & color processing)

Storage: Local file system + JSON file (no database, no authentication)

Core Functional Requirements:

A clean, modern landing page UI with:

Multi-image upload section

Text search bar

Results gallery grid

Image Upload Functionality:

Users can upload multiple images at once

Images are saved to a local uploads/ folder

Each image is automatically processed after upload

AI Processing Pipeline (Backend):

OCR: Extract readable text from images using EasyOCR (for screenshots, documents, bills)

Image understanding: Identify basic image type (photo, screenshot, document)

Color detection: Extract dominant color and map it to human-readable colors (blue, red, green, white, etc.)

Store extracted metadata (text, detected objects, colors) in a JSON file (metadata/data.json)

Natural Language Search:

User enters a plain-English query

Backend splits query into keywords

Matches keywords against stored OCR text, detected objects, and colors

Assigns relevance scores and returns the most relevant images

Results Display:

Display matched images in a responsive grid

Sort by relevance (best match first)

Architecture Constraints:

No database (use JSON as lightweight metadata storage)

No login/authentication

No cloud services

MVP-focused, hackathon-ready

Project Structure Requirement:
Generate the project using a clean structure like:

/uploads
/metadata/data.json
/ai (ocr.py, color.py, vision.py)
/templates (index.html)
/static (style.css, script.js)
app.py
requirements.txt


UI Expectations:

Modern, dark or neutral theme

Clean typography

Simple animations or hover effects

Professional hackathon demo look

Extra Instructions:

Code should be beginner-friendly and well-structured

Add comments explaining each major step

Ensure the app can be run directly on Replit with one click

The output should be a working MVP, not just mock UI

Context:
This project is being built for a college AI hackathon where judges will evaluate real-world relevance, AI usage, system design, and demo quality. Focus on clarity, correctness, and demo stability over complexity.
